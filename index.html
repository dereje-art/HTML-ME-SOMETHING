        <h2>Addis Ababa, city</h2>
        <p id="Ad">"I was born in Addis Ababa,Ethiopia,at Zewditu memorial Hospital.
            My family lived in Addis Ababa.Mount Entoto is the highest peak
            on the Entoto Mountains,which Overlooks the city of Addis Ababa,
            the capial of Ethiopia.
            Entoto ( እንጦጦ)
            The Hills Entoto is an important isolating line, to the north water flows to the Blue Nile,
            to the south to the Awash River. Mount Entoto is the highest peak, reaching 3,200 meters above sea level.
            The area of Entoto, a region on the edge of Ethiopia’s capital city, the hills were the site of Meneliks
            Capital befor addis ababa wea founed in 1887. Emperor Menelik II made his permanent camp there in1881.
            Taytu left the Entoto Mountain camp because of the unlikable cool temperature and was drawn to the site of 
            Addis Ababa to the hot springs. And also it is difficult to provision and there was a shortage of wood and 
            to have named the new capital Addis Ababa, or New Flower. What most attracted Queen Taytu’s consort, 
            were the hot springs on the lower south-facing slopes at a place called Filwoha were she and many companies
            paid frequent visits to enjoy the hot gushing mineral waters. The fresh and cool air, the exuberant flora and 
            the pungent aroma of the eucalyptus trees alongside the road make the hills wonderful which its panoramic view
            of the city and the surrounding areas."
